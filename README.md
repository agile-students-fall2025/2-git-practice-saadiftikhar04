# Saad’s Git Practice Repo

## Project: Insect Game
This repository includes **Insect**, a simple game I developed as my **Intro to Computer Science final project**. It was my first exposure to building a complete application from scratch — covering planning, coding, debugging, and presenting the final product.

## Interesting Article
- **Title:** The Twelve-Factor App  
- **Link:** https://12factor.net/

## Why I Found It Interesting
I like how the twelve factors turn messy app deployment into a clean checklist: config in environment, strict separation of build/release/run, logs as event streams, and stateless processes. These ideas map nicely to modern cloud + container workflows and explain *why* CI/CD pipelines are set up the way they are.

The article also reinforces reproducibility and portability: if you follow these principles, moving from dev to prod (or from one cloud to another) is far less painful. That mindset is useful beyond web apps—e.g., ML projects benefit from the same discipline with configs, dependencies, and one-command builds.
