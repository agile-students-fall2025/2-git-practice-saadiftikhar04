# Saad’s Git Practice Repo + Shaf Khalid’s Reflections

## Interesting Article
- **Title:** The Twelve-Factor App

## Why We Found It Interesting
### Saad Iftikhar’s Perspective
I like how the twelve factors turn messy app deployment into a clean checklist: config in environment, strict separation of build/release/run, logs as event streams, and stateless processes. These ideas map nicely to modern cloud + container setups.

The article also reinforces reproducibility and portability: if you follow these principles, moving from dev to prod (or from one cloud to another) is far less painful. That mindset is useful beyond web apps—e.g., ML projects benefit from the same discipline.

### Shaf Khalid’s Comments
I appreciated Saad’s take on the Twelve-Factor App article, especially how Saad connected its principles to modern workflows like cloud deployments and even machine learning projects. He noted that Saad’s focus on reproducibility, portability, and clean separation of concerns shows a strong understanding of why these principles matter in real-world development. I felt that Saad captured not just what the twelve factors are, but why they remain so relevant across different domains of software engineering.
